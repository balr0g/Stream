A record of action items I know I need to get to.

• Remove most of the code in ColorGradientView and put it in View Controllers.

• Have anaylizers manage their own accessory views.

• Make "Follows PC" dissasembler option know about PULS PC and PULU PC, and TFR zero into PC.

• Change option dictionary keys to use regular names, and not View Controller names.

• Make a blocker that needs an accessory settings view.

• Figure out why the database doesn't validate when I add a sub-stream.
